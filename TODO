* For each sample / measurement, add reference to parent collection / plate
* Should there be an extracted dictionary for each well? (the apply call for a sample is different than the apply for a plate)

* There may be issues with logicle transformation currently. plotting may cause the transformation to be applied twice!

* add copy method to all containers.

What would be nice to have:

1. FCM data be addressable by channel names instead of indexes
    this could help avoid really non-obvious problems when fcs files have been collected with different settings
    and user does not use name_to_index attribute

2. function used with apply to return a dictionary instead of just the values... ??

3. Print on FCPlate should show loaded data not the underlying DataFrame
