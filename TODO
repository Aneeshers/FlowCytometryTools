* For each sample / measurement, add reference to parent collection / plate
	- JF: Agreed. Not sure how to implement as a MutableMapping is not hashable. 
	
* Re-arrange metadata to contain channel info as dict/DataFrame

* FCSample channels property to extract from meta, rather than data.

* Consider changing the type checking on Collections to allow them to 
contain sub-collections of the same type, or any object that implements
so necessary attributes (e.g.: ID, apply, plot, etc').

* Change all 'Samples' to 'Measurements'. !!!! This is a major API change!!!!

* Remove 'Base' from names of base classes

* add 'to_orderd' method to SampleCollection

* add 'gate' method to Sample

* remove batch_fcs

* Have Plate objects just be short names for OrderedCollections

* refactor plotting

* fix default limits for figures. change tick marks according to scale.

* add colorbar to 2D histograms.

* add axis labels to one(?) subplot in grid_plot. 

What would be nice to have:

1. FCM data be addressable by channel names instead of indexes
    this could help avoid really non-obvious problems when fcs files have been collected with different settings
    and user does not use name_to_index attribute

2. function used with apply to return a dictionary instead of just the values... ??

3. Print on FCPlate should show loaded data not the underlying DataFrame

4. implement decorator that checks if attribute is set and is not None.
If it is not, return some default (None). Otherwise call wrapped function.
Tricky part is to still have the wrapped function signature and docstring
exposed.

5. Add dedicated exceptions with informative messages for cases where user 
is trying to operate on an unassigned/None attribute.

6. Support 1D (or n-D) OrderedCollection 

7. Allow trimming of ordered collection to remove rows/cols of all nans.

8. Allow labeling rows/cols in plots of ordered collection
